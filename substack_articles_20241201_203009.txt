I read this story on the book The 33 Laws of Business and Life, written by Steven Bartlett (host of the podcast _The Diary Of A CEO_).

It illustrates how an insight from Psychology, and an attitude of being a _problem-seeker_ (instead of a _problem-solver_) unlocked hundreds of millions for Domino‚Äôs Pizza.

This is an amazing business story with a deep lesson for all entrepreneurs out there!

> **üü† Steven Bartlett:**
> 
> In 2008, Domino‚Äôs Pizza experienced an interesting operational and customer experience challenge. Customers who were waiting longer than they expected for their pizza would phone Domino‚Äôs to ask where it was. The whole process of pizza making would then be interrupted, because the person making the pizza would be asked why there was a delay by the person who‚Äôd answered the phone, and the customer would ultimately be given a vague and uncertain answer. A calling customer was unwittingly delaying the delivery of their own pizza, because of the lack of operational transparency they‚Äôd been given.
> 
> Some pizza chains responded to this challenge by investing in warming bags to keep the pizzas hot, hiring more staff and drivers, launching money-back guarantees on delivery times and offering free breadsticks for slow deliveries, but their phones carried on ringing. What they were all missing was the psychological frustration at the heart of the problem ‚Äì people didn‚Äôt want faster delivery ‚Äì they wanted less uncertainty about their delivery. Domino‚Äôs understood this, and in 2008, using their pre-existing in-house order-management software, they created the now famous ‚ÄòDomino‚Äôs Pizza Tracker‚Äô, which shows customers exactly where their order is in a five-step process.
> 
> This small psychological insight and the innovation it produced changed Domino‚Äôs business. Angry phone calls plummeted, customer satisfaction and retention skyrocketed and Domino‚Äôs saved and made hundreds of millions in the process. 
> 
> Research published in the journal Nature showed that it‚Äôs less psychologically stressful to know something negative is about to happen (e.g., our pizza is going to be 30 minutes late) than to be left in uncertainty (e.g., we have no idea where the late pizza is). That‚Äôs because the area of our brain that tries to anticipate consequences is most fired up when we‚Äôre faced with uncertainty ‚Äì it‚Äôs on edge. As Rory Sutherland explains in his book Alchemy, a ‚ÄòDELAYED‚Äô alert on your scheduled flight is much more mentally irritating than a ‚ÄòDELAYED 50 MINUTES‚Äô alert.

    The philosophy of Alan Kay aligns here ‚Äî he says is much better to be a "problem-finder" than it is to be a "problem-solver". Because finding the right problem to solve is the real deal! (Solving the problem is the last thing you do). But schools never rewarded us to be "problem-finders" ‚Äî we were only rewarded to solve problems. 
    
    But the thing is, even if we excel at solving problems, it doesn't matter (in the real world -- outside of Academia) if we are solving the wrong problem! As Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman say, picking the right thing to work on is much more important than how hard you work.
    
    ‚ÄúIf I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.‚Äù
    **- Albert Einstein** "In an age of infinite leverage, judgment is the most important skill."**- Naval Ravikant**
    
    
    After reading the story, I was reminded of this quote from Charlie Munger, where he points out the importance of having different models in your head:

> **üü† Charlie Munger:**
> 
> What is elementary, worldly wisdom? Well, the first rule is that you can‚Äôt really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ‚Äôem back. If the facts don‚Äôt hang together on a latticework of theory, you don‚Äôt have them in a usable form.
> 
> You‚Äôve got to have models in your head. And you‚Äôve got to array your experience‚Äîboth vicarious and direct‚Äîon this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and fail in life. You‚Äôve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.
> 
> What are the models? Well, the first rule is that you‚Äôve got to have multiple models‚Äîbecause if you have just one or two that you‚Äôre using, the nature of human psychology is such that you‚Äôll torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least you‚Äôll think it does. You become the equivalent of a chiropractor, who, of course, is the great boob in medicine. It‚Äôs > 
> And the models have to come from multiple disciplines‚Äîbecause all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That‚Äôs why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don‚Äôt have enough models in their heads. So you‚Äôve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines. 
> 
> You may say, ‚ÄúMy god, this is already getting way too tough.‚Äù But fortunately, it isn‚Äôt that tough‚Äîbecause 80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.

## üü† Get Access to my personal Notebook of Nuggets

üìÅ All insights in this letter are saved and classified in a searchable Database, which (as of November 2024) contains more than 2,400 timeless insights (sourced directly from the most influential doers and entrepreneurs).

I call it the ‚ÄúDoers Notebook‚Äù and I‚Äôve opened it for anyone who wants it.

**ü§î** _**Why did I build this?**_

Well, as the Latin motto goes, ‚ÄúA chief part of learning is simply knowing where you can find a thing.‚Äù And since it‚Äôs all üîé searchable, you only need to type a keyword to immediately get a list of insights related to it!

For instance, if I‚Äôm unsure about how to get more sales in my business, I can simply type the word ‚Äúsales‚Äù and immediately get 88 search results! In this case from Jim Edwards, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Balaji Srinivasan, Nassim Taleb, and many other individuals.

It‚Äôs 
And this is extremely valuable because it can significantly decrease the error rate in our judgment.

> ‚ÄúIn an age of infinite leverage [code and media], judgment is the most important skill.‚Äù
> 
> \- Naval Ravikant

I actually made a video where I go through the list of insights i got for the keywords ‚Äúsales‚Äù and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù. So, if you wanna get better at sales or learn to be more creative (and also see all the features of the database and how you can get access) then definitely check out the video üëá

Hey friend!

For today‚Äôs letter I picked a nugget from the renowned entrepreneur Brad Jacobs, on his book _[How To Make a Few Billion Dollars](https://substack.com/redirect/a1bdbeca-d9d4-402f-a6b7-1dacc7f8f298?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k)_.

He talks about a _**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**_ that greatly influenced his life and his business career. And I realized it‚Äôs perfectly consistent with the teachings of Buddhism and Stoicism!

> Accepting your own imperfections is the gateway to an even more daring mindset: accepting the world as it is, not as you wish it would be.

> This is another fruit of my adventures in cognitive behavior therapy. About 20 years ago, my wife and I went to some workshops on mindfulness led by Marsha Linehan, whose techniques incorporate a core principle she calls radical acceptance. This boils down to being fully present in the moment and accepting reality. It requires that you let go of the illusion of control by acknowledging the facts as they are, even though you may want them to be different.
    
    
    "What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true."

    "To all that happens, I say 'yes.‚Äù
    **- Kamal Ravikant (Naval's brother and author of the book** _**Love Yourself 
> Radical acceptance has many practical applications in business. For the oil traders I trained, it was, ‚ÄúBlock out how much you won or lost on your trade and focus on the best thing to do right now. If you think the market‚Äôs going up, buy more. If you think the market‚Äôs going down, sell‚Äîand make sure you can quantify the risk involved in each action. It‚Äôs that simple.‚Äù 
    
    
    "Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense."

In theory, this legislation was going to allocate about $600 billion to rebuild the nation‚Äôs infrastructure, beginning with roads, bridges, and tunnels.

## ‚úçÔ∏è New Essay

I recently co-authored (with [Brian David Crane](https://substack.com/redirect/0721ff9e-19c4-4ef5-a35c-6522af3d8f85?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k)) an essay in which we explored the differences between teachers, mentors, and gurus.

[](https://substack.com/redirect/8e48f51e-7b0b-4e35-a0c5-9b5508cbcbde?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k)  
  
**Here‚Äôs a quick Summary Guide of the Essay:**

1\. Avoid being a _follower_. Instead, be a _student_.

  * A _follower_ is someone who blindly accepts whatever idea some authority feeds him.

  * A _student_ is someone who takes ideas and advice but verifies them for himself to assess their truth. What he does is the product of his own conclusion. Moreover, he seeks to understand ideas rather than memorize them.

2\. Be very selective when deciding whom to learn from. Understand that mentors (teachers with mastery of their skill) are an invaluable source of knowledge, whereas teachers with only an academic background are not particularly great (especially outside of Maths and Science).

3\. To associate with a mentor, invest time and effort in meeting the mentor‚Äôs needs. You have to give value to get value in return.

üìÅ All insights in this letter are saved and classified in a searchable Database, which (as of September 2024) contains more than 2,000 timeless insights (sourced directly from the most influential people in the world)

I call it the ‚ÄúDoers Notebook‚Äù and I‚Äôve recently opened it for anyone who wants it.

ü§î Why did I build this?

Well, as the Latin motto goes, [‚ÄúA chief part of learning is simply knowing where you can find a thing.‚Äù](https://substack.com/redirect/63ce9fec-eb10-443c-88c5-b83f7336f3f0?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k) And since it‚Äôs all üîé searchable, we only need to type a keyword to immediately get a list of insights related to it!

For instance, if I‚Äôm unsure about how to get more sales in my business, I can simply type the word ‚Äúsales‚Äù and immediately get 88 search results! In this case from Jim Edwards, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Balaji Srinivasan, Nassim Taleb, and many other remarkable individuals!

It‚Äôs 
And this is extremely valuable because it can significantly decrease the error rate in our judgment.

> ‚ÄúIn an age of infinite leverage [code and media], judgment is the most important skill.‚Äù
> 
> \- Naval Ravikant

I actually made a video where I go through the list of insights i got for the keywords ‚Äúsales‚Äù and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù.

So, if you wanna get better at sales or learn to be more creative (and also see all the features of the database and how you can get access) then definitely check out the video üëá

Hey friend!

Today I bring you key insight for life, which I discovered in a book that Naval Ravikant mentioned in one of his latest interviews this year ([here‚Äôs the exact timestamp in the interview](https://substack.com/redirect/92409d3e-9e21-4fa1-8d3f-f2c10aa617b3?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k)). I remember that Mohnish Pabrai also recommended this book, so of course with these 2 invaluable references I went ahead and bought the book!

I was just skimming through the most popular highlights on the Kindle book, and found a brilliant insight, which was definitely my _nugget highlight_ of the last 2 weeks.

I also complemented it with a passage from Mohnish Pabrai and Warren Buffet.

> 
> To the untrained eye _**ego-climbing**_ and _**selfless climbing**_ may appear identical.

> Both kinds of climbers place one foot in front of the other. Both breathe in and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested.

> But what a difference!
> 
> The _**ego-climber**_ is > 
> What he‚Äôs looking for, what he wants, is all around him, but he doesn‚Äôt want that because it is all around him. Every step‚Äôs an effort, both physically and spiritually, because he imagines his goal to be external and distant.

> ‚Ä¶
> 
> Mountains should be climbed with as little effort as possible and without desire.
> 
> The reality of your own nature should determine the speed. If you become restless, speed up. If you become winded, slow down. You climb the mountain in an equilibrium between restlessness and exhaustion. Then, when you‚Äôre no longer thinking ahead, each footstep isn‚Äôt just a means to an end but a unique event in itself. This leaf has jagged edges. This rock looks loose. From this place the snow is less visible, even though closer. These are things you should notice anyway.
> 
> To live only for some future goal is shallow. It‚Äôs the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here‚Äôs where things grow.
> 
> But of course, without the top you can‚Äôt have any sides. It‚Äôs the top that defines the sides. So on we go . . . we have a long way . . . no hurry . . . just one step after the next . . . with a little Chautauqua for entertainment. . . . Mental reflection is so much more interesting than TV it‚Äôs a shame more people don‚Äôt switch over to it. They probably think what they hear is unimportant but it never is.

I say: ‚ÄòLookit. Would you rather be the world‚Äôs greatest lover, but have everyone think you‚Äôre the world‚Äôs worst lover? Or would you rather be the world‚Äôs worst lover but have everyone think you‚Äôre the world‚Äôs greatest lover?

In this letter, I send you my two favorite passages from the book _**[Setting the Table](https://substack.com/redirect/b49d9381-1f4d-489d-8739-ce52e7fe96c5?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k)**_ , by Danny Meyer (the founder of the restaurant chain Shake Shack and many fine restaurants in New York).

I first heard about him on this [YouTube video from the renowned VC investor Bill Gurley](https://substack.com/redirect/1e08a69d-0444-418a-8733-d28ab5f31f2a?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k). And when he talked about Danny, it immediately caught my attention.

Even though I‚Äôm not planning to open any restaurants, I was super curious to learn everything about his life and his businesses. And I did find many things of how he comes up with business ideas and how he runs his businesses that are completely applicable to any kind business ‚Äî digital or physical.

In this letter you can read the two passages that resonated the most with me and I found the most useful for any type of business.

## üí°Nugget

> **Passage #1:**
> 
> My ultimate mission for any new restaurant is always to begin with a subject I love, zero in on what I enjoy most about it, and then envision a new context for it. I take something that is already accessible (such as frozen custard) and try to make it better; or I take what‚Äôs excellent (a selection of artisanal cheeses or a wine list) and try to present it in a more user-friendly context. I‚Äôm never out to invent a new cuisine. Instead, I‚Äôm interested in creating a fresh ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù dining experience; and then, > 
> I feel the entrepreneurial spark when some instinct tells me that a certain dining ‚Äúcontext‚Äù doesn‚Äôt currently exist but should exist. I then ask myself a series of questions that force me to examine and challenge the status quo‚Äîand then change it. Each question begins with these five words: ‚ÄúWho ever wrote the rule‚Ä¶?‚Äù Who ever wrote the rule, for example, that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy a refined dining experience, with the finest ingredients, served on Limoges china, in a rustic tavern? Or that you can‚Äôt serve slow-smoked pulled pork with a glass of champagne or Chianti Classico, just off Park Avenue? Or that you can‚Äôt create a classic burger-and-shakes drive-in in New York City, where no one drives? Or that live jazz sounds good only in a late-night club and only if everyone around you is smoking? 
> 
> Each venture has taken shape differently. It could be that I know of a chef I really want to work with and now must search for an idea and a location (Gramercy Tavern); or I could have what I think is a compelling idea and then look for a location and a chef (Union Square Cafe); or I could be in love with a specific location and need to find the chef and the idea (The Modern).
> 
> Context is everything. What has guided me most as an entrepreneur is the confluence of passion and opportunity (and sometimes serendipity) that leads to the right context for the right idea at the right time in the right place and for the right value. I have never relied on or been interested in market analysis to create a new business model. I am my own test market. I am far more intuitive than analytical. If I sense an opportunity to reframe something I‚Äôm passionately interested in, I give it my absolute best shot. 
> 
> The commitment to add something fresh to an existing dialogue informs every decision my colleagues and I make, from the locations we select to our staff uniforms to virtually every dish we serve. Whether the topic is poached striped bass, tuna tartare, a BLT, or a cup of hot chocolate, I challenge my chefs to tell me exactly what they‚Äôre planning to do differently from or better than the next guy. Years ago, for instance, we knew that we needed to offer steak on the menu at Union Square Cafe‚Äîin a city that already claims some of the world‚Äôs greatest steak houses. I also knew there was no way we could outdo Sparks, The Palm, Peter Luger, Smith and Wollensky, or any of the other temples of beef. So we came up with the idea of our smoked steak‚Äîa great piece of meat, cold-smoked, grilled, and then served with world-class mashed potatoes and topped with fried leeks. Sirloin steak could have been a kind of ‚Äúevery restaurant needs a steak‚Äù throwaway on our menu. Instead, our smoked steak became a reason people return over and over again to Union Square Cafe. Still, in reframing something that people are familiar with, the outcome must be excellent and must never seem contrived.

> **Passage #2:**
> 
> Imagine if every business were a lightbulb and that for each lightbulb the primary goal was to attract the most moths possible. Now what if you learned that 49 percent of the reason moths were attracted to a bulb was for the quality of its light (brightness being the task of the bulb) and that 51 percent of the attraction was to the warmth projected by the bulb (heat being connected with the feeling of the bulb). It‚Äôs remarkable to me how many businesses shine brightly when it comes to acing the tasks but emanate all the warmth of a cool fluorescent light.
> 
> That explains how a flawless four-star restaurant can actually attract far fewer loyal fans than a two-or three-star place with soul. In business, I want to be overcome with moths. Our staff must be

Hello Friend!

Lately I‚Äôve been re-reading my highlights of _[The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://substack.com/redirect/e6d00587-585f-429a-8dd2-91ab4a4e0c30?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k) _(one of my all-time favorite books), and one of these highlights stopped me to reflect for quite some time‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs probably the third or forth time I‚Äôve read this particular highlighted passage, but it stops me to reflect every single time I read it! Because it goes against human nature (so our mind tends to forget about it), but it‚Äôs critical that we remember it and apply it (if we want to ever achieve anything of worth in life).

So I picked this passage for today‚Äôs letter!

> 
> One definition of a moment of suffering is ‚Äúthe moment when you see things exactly the way they are.‚Äù This whole time, you‚Äôve been convinced your business is doing great, and really, you‚Äôve ignored the signs it‚Äôs not doing well. Then, your business fails, and you suffer because you‚Äôve been putting off reality. You‚Äôve been hiding it from yourself.
> 
> The good news is, the moment of suffering‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre in pain‚Äîis a moment of truth. It is a moment where you‚Äôre forced to embrace reality the way it actually is. Then, you can make meaningful change and progress. You can only make progress when you‚Äôre starting with the truth.
> 
> The hard thing is seeing the truth. To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn‚Äôt want to face the truth. The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality. 
> 
> _What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true. Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality._
> 
> Imagine we‚Äôre going through something difficult > 
> You know the correct answer, but your friend can‚Äôt see it, because they‚Äôre in the moment of suffering and pain. They‚Äôre still wishing reality was different. The problem isn‚Äôt reality. The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say it. The same thing happens when I make decisions.

üìÅ All the ideas in this article are saved and classified in a searchable database, which (as of August 2024) contains 2,100+ timeless insights, sourced directly from remarkable Doers and Entrepreneurs (picked from books and interviews/podcasts).

I call this database _Doers Notebook,_ and I‚Äôve recently opened it for anyone who wants to access it!

ü§î Why did I build this?

Well, as the Latin motto goes, [‚ÄúA chief part of learning is simply knowing where you can find a thing.‚Äù](https://substack.com/redirect/e49e0e64-356a-4757-b97d-da3d8eaac277?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k) And since it‚Äôs all üîé searchable, we only need to type a keyword to immediately get a list of insights related to it!

For instance, if I‚Äôm unsure about how to get more sales in my business, I can simply type the word ‚Äúsales‚Äù and immediately get 88 search results! In this case from Jim Edwards, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Balaji Srinivasan, Nassim Taleb, and many other remarkable individuals.

It‚Äôs 
And this is super valuable because it can significantly decrease the error rate in our judgment.

> ‚ÄúIn an age of infinite leverage [code and media], judgment is the most important skill.‚Äù
> 
> \- Naval Ravikant

I actually made a video where I went through the list of insights I got for the keywords ‚Äúsales‚Äù and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù. So, if you wanna get better at sales and learn to be more creative (and also see all the features of the database and how you can get access) then definitely check out the video üëá

Hello Friend!

Today‚Äôs insight come from a speech that Mo Gawdat gave at a Tony Robbins event.

I think it‚Äôs extremely powerful. It gives us a robust mental tool to process negative life events or intrusive thoughts so that we can either be _free from them_ or _free despite them_.

The minute I walk out of her apartment, she had called me in, in the morning, made me breakfast, hugged me when I came in. The minute I walk out, my brain says "Aya doesn't love you anymore." It was in Montreal. I promise you, I stopped in the middle of the street and I said, "what the fuck did you just say?"

> In Montreal, it's okay. We're all, you know, > 
> **Is that true?** Number one. Okay?

> If it isn't true, drop it. Why would you ever be unhappy about something that's not true? If you're not going to be homeless, or you're citizen number 7 billion in the world that's going to become homeless, there are 6.99 billion that are going to become homeless before you... then wait! Be unhappy then. Okay?
> 
> But if it's true that there is a winter coming, then question number two: **‚ÄúWhat can I do about it?‚Äù** Okay.
> 
> Question number two is very straightforward. What can I do to fix this? By the way, there is nothing you can do about the winter coming. There is nothing you can do. We'll come to that in question three. But if the thought in your head is: my business is going to decline because of the winter that's coming, right? That's an easy question to ask. What can I do about it? Can I cut expenses? Can I find new clients? Can I find new lines of business? And when you ask that question, two things happen:
> 
>   * One is... you make the world better. You actually solve the problem instead of sitting in a corner and complaining about it.
> 
>   * And the second most interesting thing is you move the thought from your incessant part of the brain, the default mode network, as they call it, to the problem-solving area of the brain. And interestingly, our brains cannot do two things at the same time. 
> 
> 

> 
> So, if you ask yourself the question, what can I do about it? Immediately, your brain stops complaining. Your brain is now in the positive mode of... What can I actually do to make things better? If there is something you can do about it, do it. If there is nothing you can do about it, then it's question number three...
> 
> And question number three is what I call the Jedi Master level of happiness. Truly, this is the ultimate level of happiness. **What can I do about the things that I cannot change, including a winter coming, including losing a child, including being stuck in traffic?** Simple as that. If you're stuck in traffic, there is nothing you can do to change the layout of the city within a second so that the traffic starts to move again. It's impossible. Okay? So question number three is: Can I accept and commit?" What can I do now to make my life better despite the presence of that problem?
> 
> [Just] "What can I do" will not fix the problem, but "what can I do to make my life better despite the problem." Okay? And when you start to think about it this way, you suddenly realize that there are lots of things you can do.
> 
> > 
> And so, What can I do? Can I accept life as it is? (not as a sign of weakness, [but] as a sign of absolute strength). The strongest of all of us are the ones that look at adversity and say ‚ÄúOkay, I get it. Don't >

Or a joyful thought"]. Okay? Literally in my third book it is a signed contract with... I call my brain "Becky" because it's a third party, it's not me! Do you understand that? You have to understand this. One of the biggest challenges in the modern world is that we think that that the voice in your head talking to you is you. It's not! If it was you talking to you... why would it need to talk? Okay?

üìÅ All the insights in this article are saved and classified in a searchable Database, which (as of August 2024) contains 2,100+ timeless insights, sourced directly from the most influential doers and entrepreneurs (handpicked from books, interviews/podcasts and articles).

I call this Database the _Doers Notebook,_ and I‚Äôve recently opened it for anyone who wants it.

ü§î Why did I build this?

Well, as the Latin motto goes, [‚ÄúA chief part of learning is simply knowing where you can find a thing.‚Äù](https://substack.com/redirect/d15acf30-cce1-4eb5-b979-010f4a89f10c?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k) And since it‚Äôs all üîé searchable, we only need to type a keyword to immediately get a list of insights related to it!

For instance, if I‚Äôm unsure about how to get more sales in my business, I can simply type the word ‚Äúsales‚Äù and immediately get 88 search results! In this case from Jim Edwards, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant, Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Balaji Srinivasan, Nassim Taleb, and many other remarkable individuals.

It‚Äôs 
And this is super valuable because it can significantly decrease the error rate in our judgment.

> ‚ÄúIn an age of infinite leverage [code and media], judgment is the most important skill.‚Äù
> 
> \- Naval Ravikant

I actually made a video where I went through the list of insights I got for the keywords ‚Äúsales‚Äù and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù. So, if you wanna get better at sales and learn to be more creative (and also see all the features of the database and how you can get access) then definitely check out the video üëá

Hey Friend!

The insight I picked today comes from Socrates, narrated by Robert Greene on his book _**[The 50th Law](https://substack.com/redirect/4c000092-232d-4966-ab5c-f50d940c3ed2?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k).**_

It‚Äôs a short but powerful story to help us become wiser!

> **üü† Robert Greene:**
> 
> One day it came to the attention of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates that the oracle at Delphi had pronounced him the wisest man in the world.
> 
> This baffled the philosopher‚Äîhe did not think himself worthy of such a decree. It made him uncomfortable.
> 
> He decided to simply go around Athens and find a person who was wiser than he‚Äîthat should be easy and it would disprove the oracle.
> 
> He engaged in many discussions with politicians, poets, craftsmen, and fellow philosophers.
> 
> He began to realize that the oracle was right.
> 
> All the people he talked to had such a certainty about things, venturing solid opinions about matters of which they had no experience; they were full of so much air. If you questioned them at all, they could not really defend their opinions, which seemed based on something they had decided years earlier.
> 
> His superiority, he realized, was that he knew that he knew nothing. This left his mind open to experiencing things as they are, the source of all knowledge.

    This same reflection is probably what drove Charles Bukowski to utter the famous line:
    
    "The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence."

## üí≠ Reflections

Here‚Äôs a collection of quotes from remarkable individuals that helps me become more enthusiastic on finding the most accurate ideas / mental models ‚Äî through this process of rigorous thinking and uncertainty:
    
    
    ‚ÄúCertainty is the place where questions go to die.‚Äù
    
    ‚Äï Dee Hock (Founder of Visa)
    
    
    "I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there."
    
    - Richard Feynman
    
    
    "To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me."
    
    - Isaac Newton
    
    
    "Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question."
    
    - Niels Bohr
    
    
    "You should take the approach that you‚Äôre wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong."
    
    - Elon Musk
    
    
    "Any year that passes in which you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is a wasted year."
    
    - Charlie Munger

## ‚úçÔ∏è Essay

I recently co-authored (with [Brian David Crane](https://substack.com/redirect/80cb97bb-272c-4d33-a46d-caa155b7cc32?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k)) an essay in which we explored the differences between wisdom and knowledge.

It‚Äôs based on the nugget of this letter, and it expands with bits from Tim Urban, Charlie Munger, Naval Ravikant and Jeff Bezos!

Hello Friend!

I think today‚Äôs nugget is not only valuable, but it‚Äôs interesting because we have a completely marketing person (Gary Halbert) and a completely product person (Marc Andreessen) fully converging in their views regarding the most important thing in a startup.

For now, try to think what‚Äôs most important: product quality, team, or market?

     "Almost everyone I‚Äôve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter."
    - Sam Altman (from his blogpost [How To Be Successful](https://substack.com/redirect/0d3a83a9-c704-482b-a3e7-1a42e144b897?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k))
    
    I think this idea from Sam Altman can be applied here in the sense of spending more time on choosing the right market, work until you get a viable product and then test it against your targeted market. If there are sales or any kind of expressed interest, keep working on refining the product! If there is no market signal, try something new or ditch that specific project.

üìÅ All the ideas in this article are saved and classified in a searchable Database, which (as of July 2024) contains nearly 2,000 timeless ideas (sourced directly from the most influential doers and entrepreneurs ‚Äî captured on books, interviews/podcasts and articles).

I call this Database the _Doers Notebook,_ and I‚Äôve recently opened it for anyone who wants it.

ü§î Why did I build this?

Well, as the Latin motto goes, [‚ÄúA chief part of learning is simply knowing where you can find a thing.‚Äù](https://substack.com/redirect/cb043294-862b-4522-a81d-5b225ffe7c93?j=eyJ1IjoiNXVldmQifQ.vLHhQ_jF-YtL0o2ERrjj3iqKO1nTBEPArlqJuxdzR5k) And since it‚Äôs all üîé searchable, we only need to type a keyword to immediately get a list of insights related to it!
